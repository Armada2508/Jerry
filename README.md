# Jerry
Control System for Jerry

## Running
The server will automatically start up on Jerry and to gain control just run Client.py and have a joystick plugged in.

## Building/Deploying
You're going to need the pygame package for the client side and the pigpio package for the server side.
To put the code on Jerry you should ftp(filezilla) the Server.py and Data.py files into the raspberry pi's directory called Jerry
